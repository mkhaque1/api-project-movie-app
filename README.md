# Movie API Project with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite

This is a movie API project built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It allows users to browse and search for movies using data retrieved from an external API.

## Features

- Display a list of movies fetched from the Movie Database API.
- Search for movies by title.
- View details of each movie, including title, overview, release date, and poster image.
- Filter movies by release year.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Vite**: A next-generation front-end tooling for building React applications.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-api-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-api-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Working with API Calls

API calls in this project are managed using the `fetch` API, which is built into modern web browsers. Here's how API calls are handled:

- The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch movie data when the component mounts.
- The `fetch` function is used to make HTTP requests to the Movie Database API.
- API response data is then processed and stored in state variables using the `useState` hook.
- Search functionality is implemented by dynamically updating the API endpoint URL based on user input.
- Movie filtering is implemented by applying JavaScript array filtering functions to the fetched movie data.
- Using `useContext` hook for providing data to all component usable.
